My game idea is survival game. The player has to kill all
zombies before dying.

There is the player and zombies. 
The player can move any direction and shoot projectiles 
to defend himself from the zombies. It has 3 lifes.
The zombies spawn randomly and follows the player. 
If a zombie touches the player, the 
player loses a life.

The player wins if he survives all 5 waves(level) of zombies.
The player loses when all his lifes are gone.

There will be 5 waves/levels. When the player finishes a level,
he gets a life.

This game is inspired by cod zombies.

I am not looking for someone with a particular skill. Just someone 
who won't do nothing.
